# Notification System Implementation

## Overview

A complete notification system has been implemented for the Avoca-do chat application, providing real-time notifications when users receive new messages.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

- Extended `User.ts` model with notification preferences:
  - Sound notifications (default: true)
  - Desktop notifications (default: true)
  - Email notifications (default: false)

### 2. API Endpoints

- `/api/notifications/unread` - Get unread message counts and detailed breakdown
- `/api/notifications/read` - Mark messages as read (specific messages, from specific sender, or all)
- `/api/notifications/preferences` - Get/update notification preferences

### 3. Real-time Notifications

- Enhanced Socket.IO server to emit notification events alongside messages
- Notification events include sender info, message preview, and timestamp

### 4. React Components

- `NotificationProvider` - Context provider for global notification state management
- `NotificationPanel` - Dropdown panel with notification list and settings
- `NotificationBadge` & `NotificationDot` - Visual indicators for unread counts

### 5. UI Integration

- Notification bell icon in dashboard header with red dot for unread messages
- Notification panel shows unread message counts by sender
- Chat page shows unread counts in user selection dropdown
- Messages automatically marked as read when viewing conversation

### 6. User Experience Features

- Browser desktop notifications (with permission request)
- Notification sound alerts (configurable)
- Visual badges and indicators throughout the app
- Settings panel to configure notification preferences
- Real-time updates without page refresh

## How It Works

1. **Message Reception**: When a new message is received, the Socket.IO server:

   - Saves the message to MongoDB with `read: false`
   - Emits a `notification` event to the recipient (if online)
   - Triggers sound/desktop notifications based on user preferences

2. **Notification Display**: The NotificationProvider:

   - Maintains real-time connection to Socket.IO server
   - Updates unread counts and notification list
   - Handles user preferences and notification actions

3. **Message Reading**: When a user:
   - Opens a conversation in chat, messages are automatically marked as read
   - Can manually mark messages as read from the notification panel
   - Real-time updates reflect across all connected devices

## Setup Requirements

To complete the setup, add a notification sound file:

1. Add `notification-sound.mp3` to the `/public` directory (optional)
2. The system gracefully falls back if no sound file is present

The notification system is now fully functional and provides a modern, real-time messaging experience!
